YTree https://www.yfull.com/tree/  is a tree of the company YFull was created in the 2013 year based on the tree ISOGG isogg.org/tree/ of the mutations on the Y chromosome. Since then, YTree is steadily increasing by using the creation of new branches and the separation of the existing subclades based on new NGS samples of the clients of YFull.

Also, for the developing YTree, YFull is using the NGS samples from the scientific papers. YFull shows on YTree the commercial and scientific samples. Every month YTree is updated.

As of May 2020, there are more than 15000 subclades. Under these subclades are located 21000 samples of clients of YFull and 2500 scientific samples.

Almost, for each subclade was calculated the age estimation based on the downstream mutations. The method of the calculation of the age estimation was published in a paper “Defining a New Rate Constant for Y-Chromosome SNPs based on Full Sequencing Data”   https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273773255_Defining_a_New_Rate_Constant_for_Y-Chromosome_SNPs_based_on_Full_Sequencing_Data (Adamov et al., 2015).
